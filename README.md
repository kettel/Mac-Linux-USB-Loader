Mac-Linux-USB-Loader
====================

Tool allowing you to put a Linux distro on a USB drive and make it bootable on Intel Macs using EFI.

====================

The intention with my fork is to get older Macs with a kernel locked in 32bit mode to run.

Macbook2,1 runs a 64bit processor but locked down. Hence, the current version won't work since it's exclusive to 64-bit EFI.

Wish me luck!
